# Rush hour calculator

Simple application to calculate a [rush hour][1] for the given data using the basic algorithm. Calculated data is shown on the chart. Application creates a website which will have this chart embedded as well as explanation and additional description to the created chart.

Application is still a WIP. Some features I am yet to add:

- Fix the output location of the chart
- Add details to the chart
- Add website creation function
- Style the website and add all the descriptions
- Make the documentation
